## Rename "All Transactions" to "Bookings" in Reading Rooms Sidebar

### Change

**File: `src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx`** (line 117)

Rename the sub-item title from `'All Transactions'` to `'Bookings'` under the Reading Rooms section. Everything else stays the same -- same URL (`/admin/bookings`), same icon, same permissions.
