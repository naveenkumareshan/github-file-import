## ✅ COMPLETED: Hostel Booking Flow Enhancements

All items from the previous plan have been implemented:

1. **Partner contact details removed** from student view (HostelRoomDetails.tsx) — only shown after booking confirmation
2. **Step 5: Review & Pay** added inline with booking summary, price breakdown, advance payment toggle, T&C checkbox, and Razorpay payment — eliminates need to navigate to separate HostelBooking page
3. **Fallback Base package** created automatically for daily/weekly duration types when no packages exist in the database
